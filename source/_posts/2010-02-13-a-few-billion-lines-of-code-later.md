[A very interesting story](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69354-a-few-billion-lines-of-code-later/fulltext)
about the practical problems the guys that developed [Coverityâ€™s](http://www.coverity.com/)
static analysis tool encountered. Shows the difference between
academic theory and practice, but applies just as much to any theory developers
usually have about a software application, before actual customers start using
it.
