People that promote Lisp usually tout the fact that you can construct new
syntax as one of its powerful features. However, when it comes to any other
programming language, a number of these people will say that the language is
wrong, because it has too much syntax. As any syntax seems to be too much, the
complaint about the syntax is actually a red herring. The real complaint is:
this language isn’t Lisp and I can’t ‘drop down’ to a lower level to adjust the
syntax to my needs.

As many people in [this thread](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1097911),
which inspired this post, point out: the
ability to create syntax is powerful, exactly because syntax increases the
usability of the language for your specific purpose. So why not create syntax
that catches 99% of the cases for which you intend the language to be used and
abolish the ability to create further syntax? The ability to create syntax
comes at a cost and the existence of so many other programming languages shows
one thing very clearly: not everyone is willing to pay that cost. Why can’t we
live with that fact, use Lisp when we need it or want to and
stop criticizing other languages for not being Lisp?
